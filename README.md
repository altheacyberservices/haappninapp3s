# haappninapp3s - A phishing page that we found on Github

This is a phishing page we found on Github and decided to fork it here in order to see how the phisher works

IMPORTANT: We forked this with the sole purpose of studying this page

Forked originally from  bigmansweetsbakers/haappninapp3s. The user bigmansweetsbakers has more phishing pages in his repo. Left the original repo name here for documentation purposes as we hope that Github closes bigmansweetsbakers account.

We also filed an abuse report to Github. We suggest you to do the same with the original repo ( bigmansweetsbakers).


# Analysis so far:

Page pulls various resorces from google storage API

Page uses hXXps://koniakowsky[.]ru/LesliePiggot5oct to get the results of the phishing attack

The phisher is hosting the page at hXXps://bigmansweetsbakers[.]github[.]io/haappninapp3s/erfhbvdbcsdcawsx.html

Page is very convincing and well made.

Code is nicely indented.

Following to the user and password data collection, the phisher shows a covid-19 related document property of JP Morgan
